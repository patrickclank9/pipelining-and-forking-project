# pipelining-and-forking-project
A project that takes a text input with bash commands, files, and the symbols: "&lt;", ">", and "|" to preform pipeline operations. 
Download main.x for the compiled program, then us a txt file like "input.txt" to run something like "cat < input.txt | wc > output.txt".
